## A systematic review of helminthiasis mapping studies

This repository contains data and code to reproduce Schluth _et al._, "Spatial parasitology and the unmapped human helminthiases," in revision, _Parasitology_. Some files are still being migrated over from [another repository](https://github.com/katieschluth/humanhelminths) or, in the case of some larger geospatial files, point to offline files.
